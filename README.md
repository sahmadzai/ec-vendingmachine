I was tasked to revitalize a vending machine to accept points earned at the Entreprenuership Center at the college of William & Mary.

## Setup
### 1. Prerequisites
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v.3.9.2.*
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/installation/#python-version) v.1.1.2*
Before proceeding with the server setup, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Python: The EC Vending Machine project requires Python version 3.9.2 or higher. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the Python website.

Flask: Flask is the web framework used for the server implementation. Install Flask version 1.1.2 or higher. You can install Flask by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```Bash
pip install flask==1.1.2
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
All of the required dependencies have been laid out in a `requirements.txt` file. To install all dependencies run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup server
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can start the Flask server to run the EC Vending Machine project. Follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to start the Flask server:
```Bash
python main.py
```
This command will launch the Flask server, and you will see output indicating that the server is running.

4. The Flask server will be accessible at http://localhost:5000. Open a web browser and enter this URL to access the EC Vending Machine application.
That's it! You have successfully set up the server for the EC Vending Machine project. Now you can proceed with using the vending machine and interacting with it through the web interface.

Note: If you encounter any issues during the setup process, refer to the project's documentation or seek assistance from the project team.
